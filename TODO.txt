- FIX DUPLICATING MapObjects ON CLICK
- Object selection:
	- If selected obj var isn't nullptr:
		- Show gizmo & handle/link movement
		- Show inspector & show obj's **linked** data inside
- IGUI.hpp (<- own BeginDrawing() & EndDrawing(), WITHOUT background clear)

After Minimum Viable Product / first release:
- Refactor Editor's ChaiScript implementation into INTERFACES/core/IScript + ChaiScript implementation
- Refactor Editor's JSON implementation into INTERFACES/core/ISerializer + JSON implementation
- Rename IDraw and RaylibDrawer into IRenderer and RaylibRenderer
