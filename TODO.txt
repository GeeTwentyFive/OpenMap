Actually, just rewrite the whole thing but better

After Minimum Viable Product / first release:
- Inspector
- Refactor Editor's ChaiScript implementation into INTERFACES/core/IScript + ChaiScript implementation
- Refactor Editor's JSON implementation into INTERFACES/core/ISerializer + JSON implementation
- Rename IDraw and RaylibDrawer into IRenderer and RaylibRenderer
- Get window initialization & management *out* of ^ IDraw/IRenderer and into INTERFACES/core/IWindower
- ...refactor all those things labeled with TODO/temporary hacky fix...
